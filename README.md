# ClinkedIn
A social media application for Inmates/Prizon systems

## Purpose
This project was designed to assist in learing ASP.Net and MVC in the .Net libraries. We utilize the 3 major verbs, `GET`, `POST`, and `DELETE` to manage a pseudo database through API calls.

## Notes
This was a week long project with three collaborators. The team was efficient and happy to work together.
